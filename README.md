The purpose of this project is to help `managers` become more effective and efficient in their everyday work by leveraging Google Cloud products such as `Google Doc` and `Google Sheet`, with a focus on Appscript. The project aims to automate repetitive tasks, streamline data analysis, and improve communication and collaboration among team members.

## This project includes the following focus:

1. Automatic data syncing: Using Appscript, the project enables managers to sync multiple sheets and consolidate data into a single master sheet for analysis and reporting. The syncing can be scheduled to run daily or hourly.
2. Task automation: Appscript is used to automate repetitive tasks, freeing up time for managers and their team members to focus on more important work.
3. Reliable reporting: The project uses Google Sheets as a base for data collection and analysis, and Google Data Studio (or other reporting tools) for presentation, enabling managers to present reliable reports and data visualizations to their bosses and team members.
4. Improved collaboration: The project fosters improved communication and collaboration among team members by streamlining data sharing and providing real-time access to data and reports.
